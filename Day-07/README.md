# Day-07 — State Management (React useState)

This is a simple React project demonstrating **state management with `useState`**.  
It includes two mini tasks:

1. **Counter** — Increment, decrement, and reset with little animations.

2. **Live Text Preview** — Type and instantly see your text preview update.
